# Primal-Dual Active Set Algorithm for Quadratic Optimization Problems

This repository includes an implementation of the Primal-Dual Active Set Algorithm (PDASA) for solving quadratic optimization problems, specifically focusing on scenarios with both lower and upper constraints.
This implementation is the basic of the numerical examples in my master thesis 'Global Convergence Theory for nonsmooth
Newton Methods applied to Quadratic Programs'.
